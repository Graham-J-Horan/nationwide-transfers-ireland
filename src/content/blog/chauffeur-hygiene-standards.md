Post-COVID, **hygiene is a luxury expectation**:

### Must-Do Practices:

- **Deep Cleaning**: After each booking (focus on touchpoints)
- **Air Purifiers**: HEPA filters in premium vehicles
- **Driver Health**: Weekly antigen tests for corporate contracts

**Certification:** Consider **GBAC STAR** accreditation for marketing edge.
